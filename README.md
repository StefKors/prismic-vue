# prismic-vue

### **ðŸš¨âš ðŸš¨ This git version of `prismic-vue/tree/nuxt` is deprecated: ðŸš¨âš ðŸš¨**

- prismic-vue@git+https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-vue.git#nuxt

It hasn't been maintained over a two year period and it won't be. To
move forward this git version will be removed from our repository in
the near future! Its purpose back then was to be used as a workaround
while waiting for a first-class Nuxt integration. Please upgrade to
the NPM version of `prismic-vue`.

We have since released a first class integration for Nuxt! Here's the
migration article:
